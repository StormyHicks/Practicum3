This was a team project, not solo work. I have removed commits and names for privacy reasons.

This application used Java, JavaScript, and ReactJS. Users can take trivia quizzes which draw their 
categories and questions from the backend. After taking the quiz, the user can save their score to 
the database. A score history can be viewed from user page. There is another section which allows 
administration users to add or remove content like new categories and questions. The application 
also contained simplistic login and registration functions. 

TECH USED: Java, JavaScript, ReactJS, CSS, MySQL, SwaggerUI, Microsoft Teams
Responsibilities: Team Management, Tech Support, Unstucking Teammates. I ran the meetings, 
wrote the documentation, fixed bugs, and provided finishing touches. I also dictated tasks, wrote 
GitHub tickets and merge branches.
